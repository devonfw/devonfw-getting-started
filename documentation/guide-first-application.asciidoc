= Build Your First devonfw Application

https://github.com/devonfw/jump-the-queue[JumpTheQueue] is a small application based on the devonfw framework, which you can create yourself by following our simple step-by-step tutorial. By doing so, you will learn about the app development workflow and gain insight into the design of a professional business information system. Please visit the JumpTheQueue wiki and start working trough the tutorial https://github.com/devonfw/jump-the-queue/wiki[*HERE*].
